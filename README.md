# TIMER

## An alarm clock that can be timed by the user.

> Project built during classes on the Explorer trail at Rocketseat educational institution.
> 
> The classes aimed to use DOM and ES Modules (EcmaScript 6 - ES6) to build an alarm clock that can have its time programmed by the user. We also work with the insertion of audio in the application.
>  
> We reinforce knowledge about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, node, events, code refactoring and separating JS into modules.
