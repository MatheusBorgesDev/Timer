# TIMER

## An alarm clock that can be timed by the user.

> The project aimed to use DOM and ES Modules (EcmaScript 6 - ES6) to build an alarm clock that can have its time programmed by the user.
> I also worked on inserting audio into the application and reinforced my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, node, events, code refactoring and separating JS into modules.
